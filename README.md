- Percentage: 18.4% in Vine and 51.5 in non-Vine

## Summary

I think thereâ€™s no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program since the percentage of five-star reviews is only 18% in the Vine program compared to 51% in the non-Vine program. 

We can perform calculations on the percentage of the one-star reviews each for the Vine and non-Vine programs. Then we can analyze and determine if there are any other biases.
